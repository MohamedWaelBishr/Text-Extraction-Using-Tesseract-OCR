CHAPTER I

A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY

‘When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced thar be would shortly be
eek bexting his elevenry-frst birthday with a party of special magniScence,
there was rauch talk and excitement in Hobbiton,

Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the
Shire for sry years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpe-
ted return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become
‘slocat legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say,
that the Hill at Bag End was full of runoels stuffed with treasure, And if that
wwas not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at.
‘Time wore on, but ir scemed to have Little effect on Mr, Baggins. At ninety

‘preserved; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark, There were some
that shook their heads and thought this was 100 much of a good thing; it

“Aptitude tests today,” I say. Caleb ie not quite a year

He nods as we pass through the front doors. My muscles
tighten the second we walk in. The atmosphere feels
hungry, like every sixteen-year-old is trying to devour as
much ae he can get of this last day. It is likely that we will
not walk these halls again after the Choosing Ceremony—
once we choose, our new factions will be responsible for
finishing our education.

Our classes are cut in half today, so we will attend all
of them before the aptitude tests, which take place after
lunch. My heart rate is already elevated.

“You aren't at all worried about what they'll tell you?” I
ask Caleb.
