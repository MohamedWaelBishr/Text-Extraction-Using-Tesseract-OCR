not walk these halls again after the Choosing Ceremony—
once we choose, our new factions will be responsible for
finishing our education.

Our classes are cut in half today, so we will attend all
of them before the aptitude tests, which take place after
lunch. My heart rate is already elevated.

“You aren't at all worried about what they'll tell you?” I

toward Faction History.

He raises an eyebrow at me. “Are you?”
